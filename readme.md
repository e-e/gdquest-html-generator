## GDQuest Html Generator

The course content available for download on Gumroad is in a really annoying format. Drop `generate-html.php` into the same directory that has all of the unzipped chapters and run `php generate-html.php` to create an `index.html` that can be dragged/dropped onto your browser to make navigating and watching the videos less cumbersome.

### `watch.php`
In order to make changes to the inlined CSS/JS, run `php watch.php` in order to watch for file changes and regenerate `index.html`
